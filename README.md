# StyleTransfer-implementation

Based on [this](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/a-neural-algorithm-of-artistic-style) research paper.

we can extract the geomtric features of an image using CNNs. This papers goes into how we can extract the "artistic style" of an image as well and combine two images. one for the geometry and other for the style.
This is a Pytorch implementation for the same using the pretrained VGG-19 model as used in the paper.
